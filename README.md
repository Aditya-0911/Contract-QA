## 📁 Python File Overview

### `app.py`
- Main entry point of the Streamlit app.
- Sets the page configuration and invokes the main UI through `show_main_page()` from `ui.py`.

---

### `ui.py`
- Contains the Streamlit tabbed interface:
  - **Document Summary Tab** – Displays summary generated by Gemini
  - **Question & Answer Tab** – Accepts user queries via text or voice and provides answers
  - **Compliance Report Tab** – Generates a structured compliance report and allows PDF download
- Interacts with `speech`, `TTS`, `QA`, and `PDF` modules

---

### `config.py`
- Stores configuration variables like:
  - Google Gemini API key
  - `wkhtmltopdf` executable path for HTML-to-PDF conversion

---

### `document_processor.py`
- Handles PDF document text extraction
- Splits long documents into manageable chunks
- Builds a FAISS vector store from chunk embeddings for semantic search

---

### `summarizer.py`
- Contains the function to prompt **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to generate a simplified summary of the contract text

---

### `qa_system.py`
- Answers user queries by:
  - Embedding the question
  - Retrieving the top relevant chunks via FAISS
  - Using Gemini to answer in plain English based on retrieved context

---

### `compliance_checker.py`
- Sends the entire contract to Gemini to:
  - Classify contract type and jurisdiction
  - Flag compliance issues
  - Suggest risk level (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Output either plain text or structured HTML format

---

### `pdf_utils.py`
- Converts compliance HTML output into a downloadable PDF using `pdfkit` and `wkhtmltopdf`
- Alternative method using ReportLab for stylized PDF reports
- Provides `generate_pdf_from_html()` function used in the UI

---

### `tts.py`
- Wraps `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality
- Supports starting and stopping speech in a thread-safe way
- Used to vocalize AI-generated answers

---

### `speech_recognition_utils.py`
- Uses `SpeechRecognition` to listen via microphone
- Converts user voice input into text to support voice-based questions

---

### `requirements.txt`
- Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project

---

## ✅ Summary

This project brings together modern AI with a user-friendly interface to automate and simplify contract analysis. The codebase is modular, easy to extend, and built for both interactivity and clarity.
